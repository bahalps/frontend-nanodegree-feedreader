# Project Overview

To run this application, just follow this [link](http://bahalps.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/).

Jasmine will automatically run the following tests on the website:

1.  RSS Feeds
    * Checks if allFeeds variable has been defined and if it contains at least one feed.
    * Checks if each feed has a name and the name is not blank.
    * Checks if each feed has a url and the url is not blank.
2.  The Menu
    * Makes sure the menu is hidden by default when the page loads.
    * Makes sure the menu displays when the icon is clicked and hides when the icon is clicked again.
3.  Initial Entries
    * Makes sure there is at least one article loaded on the page when the loadFeed function loads a new feed.
4.  New Feed Selection
    * Makes sure the content of the page changes when the loadFeed function loads a new feed.
    
All tests should pass and the results will be displayed at the bottom of the page.
